CHANGELOG
=========

## HEAD (Unreleased)

Breaking changes:

- Resolved an issue when some output properties were erroneously presented as input properties too
(notable example: `tier` in `sku` of a `storage.StorageAccount`)

New features:

- Added `appplatform.getResourceUploadUrl` and other `get*` POST-based invokes ([#11](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/11))
- Resource import is now supported ([#7](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/7))

Bug fixes:

- Fixed handling of `@odata.type` fields ([#18](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/18))
- Handle unspecified types in Open API specs more gracefully: accept an "any" type (e.g., `object` in .NET) for inputs and ignore
  them for outputs ([#14](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/14))
- Fixed the serialization of `CompositeIndexes` property of `SqlResourceSqlContainer`
  ([#28](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/28))
- Data Factory enum properties (e.g. `CompressionCodec`) changed to strings
  ([#29](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/29))
- API types "object" are mapped to "any" type in Pulumi.
  Fixed [#30](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/30) and [#32](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/32)
